What were the most obvious ways that quality could be improved throughout hospitalization and in the transition to home? We should all really want to know. What should we improve?�\\n\\nHarlan�s tweet generated many good replies, and several days ago I asked Harlan what he would think about me posing this question on his behalf here in Inspire.

Needless to say, i freaked out(felt sad, angry, depressed, embarrassed, hopeless, in denial, etc etc all at the same time). Clinical doctor then referred me to a STD specialist doctor for treatment.\\n\\n(2) 19th June 2019 (Wednesday), when i went to see the specialist doctor preparing to ask for medication treatment, to my surprise, he immediately and confidently dismissed my previous test result saying that it's false positive after asking whether i have any symptoms for herpes(both oral and genital). I told him i do not but told him to examine my body(waist and above) as i'm not sure the spots on my upper body(waist above) are acne, moles or herpes. The specialist examined my body and confirmed it's not herpes. I have never experienced any cold sores or any itching/pain on my genital areas. He did ask me do i have any lesions on my genitalia area and i verbally described it to him none(do not feel pain, itching or feel any sore) and it doesn't look like those pictures i've googled but did told him i have white spots around my penis shaft n suggested it could be fordyce n he just agreed with me(without examining it though). **NOTE: (1) the white spots around my penis shaft doesnt seem to cause me any pain or any discomfort at all....(2)gotta say though, in my mind i was like \"dafuq?? just like that ?? i really have no herpes despite the report??\" kinda find it hard to believe to my surprise...because just 24 hours ago i was prepared to live a single life for the rest of my life then the next day i'm hearing another news, one heck of a roller coaster of emotion**\\n\\n(3) In summary, he told me:\\n(a) i do not have herpes despite my test result saying i have oral herpes,\\n\\n(b) my previous blood test result is definitely a false positive(yeah, he's so confident to the point he didn't even use words like \"highly unlikely\" or \"unlikely\" n went on to boast his credentials of being a practitioner for STDs for 30 years n being trained by professionals, dealing with over-thinking patients like me, etc etc) because the IgG/IgM test method is obsolete and inaccurate(he went on to give me an example saying that if a weighing scale machine only has 50% chance of being accurate would u still use that weighing scale machine to measure your weight?? kinda make sense to me), and said that the more and most accurate test method is the Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test,\\n\\n(c) despite the obsolete and inaccurate methods of IgG/IgM test, some general practitioners still do such test because of wanting to earn money,\\n\\n(d) people without showing any symptoms of herpes(both oral and genital) despite their positive result conducted through IgG/IgM test are false positive results,\\n\\n(e) that he will only consider conducting a PCR test on me ONLY IF i have any symptoms(lesions, outbreaks,etc) or suspected symptom(then i should only go see him again for a physical examination of the suspected symptom before deciding to conduct a PCR test),\\n\\n(f) not to go mess around by going for another blood test to get confirmation because of reason mentioned in (b) and the fact that this will cause me psychological anxiety/stress due to over-analysing and told me to stop reading stuff on the internet(lol, but im still here posting this :P)\\n\\n(g) even if i really do have oral herpes even after a PRC test, then it's still non-harmful and i can still live a normal life, have a family and kids(then he went on further to explain things like half of world population has HSV-1 and how non-harmful it is, the male sperm doesn't carry the herpes, blablabla i don't know he told me lots of stuff i couldn't remember all of it)\\n**UNRELATED SIDE NOTE: the time i spent talking and consulting with the specialist was around 40minues+, he was actually very down to earth n a chill person**\\n\\nCONCLUSION:\\nso because after consulting my doctor, i realised i should've taken a picture of the white/green spots around my penis shaft to show him so he can have a better view for his confirmation rather through my verbal description. That's why, right now, i'm asking the internet/world for your personal opinion....I'm not sure when exactly i have these white spots though, it's quite possible i may have it like few years back especially when i was like 21(2012), still not sure, just a guess,...bottom line i don't know when i have it.....So what's your opinion on the picture ??\\n\\nThanks in advance for reading and/or replying this post.\\nEdited June 19, 2019 at 1:08 pm</td>\n","      <td>June 19, 2019 at 12:56 pm</td>\n","      <td>{'tones': [{'score': 0.607074, 'tone_id': 'sadness', 'tone_name': 'Sadness'}, {'score': 0.651158, 'tone_id': 'joy', 'tone_name': 'Joy'}, {'score': 0.862401, 'tone_id': 'tentative', 'tone_name': 'Tentative'}, {'score': 0.783643, 'tone_id': 'analytical', 'tone_name': 'Analytical'}]}</td>\n","      <td>[[Sadness, 60.71%], [Joy, 65.12%], [Tentative, 86.24%], [Analytical, 78.36%]]</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>khack2471</td>\n","      <td>https://www.inspire.com/m/khack2471/</td>\n","      <td>Since I have had hpv on numerous of occasions in the past and experienced genital warts and had them removed, will I be contagious for the rest of my life?

They pumped me with a bunch of medication during delivery that helped with making sure the herpes didn�t transmit. Its been 12 years for me. In some ways it�s gotten easier. Starting over with a new person at my age seems so daunting.</td>\n","      <td>June 28, 2019 at 3:19 am</td>\n","      <td>{'tones': [{'score': 0.605195, 'tone_id': 'sadness', 'tone_name': 'Sadness'}, {'score': 0.581329, 'tone_id': 'fear', 'tone_name': 'Fear'}, {'score': 0.62201, 'tone_id': 'tentative', 'tone_name': 'Tentative'}]}</td>\n","      <td>[[Sadness, 60.52%], [Fear, 58.13%], [Tentative, 62.2%]]</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>Brian</td>\n","      <td>https://www.inspire.com/m/Brian/</td>\n","      <td>Dear members,\\n\\nMany of us, including myself, have spent a good bit of time in hospitals, as a patient or a caregiver or both, and have ideas about how hospitals can improve.\\n\\nDr. Harlan Krumholz, a cardiologist, healthcare scientist, and health care improvement expert at Yale University, recently asked the following questions on Twitter:\\n\\n�I am curious to know from patients, especially those recently in the hospital: What do you wish we did better? What were the most obvious ways that quality could be improved throughout hospitalization and in the transition to home? We should all really want to know. What should we improve?�\\n\\nHarlan�s tweet generated many good replies, and several days ago I asked Harlan what he would think about me posing this question on his behalf here in Inspire. As Harlan is, I�m proud to say, a fan of Inspire, he readily agreed. I invite you to reply to this discussion with answers to the questions he posed, so that we can help to drive positive change in hospitals.\\n\\nWe would like to create a summary from your answers and share them, in an anonymous fashion (no Inspire username), as an essay in a publication, or present the combined insights at a conference. We will let you know of any publication or presentation of this information. Your perspectives matter, and together we can make an impact.\\n\\nI look forward to reading your thoughts and ideas, and if for any reason you would prefer that we not include your answer in our summary, just write, �Don�t share� in your reply.\\n\\nTogether we're better,\\nBrian Loew\\nFounder, Inspire</td>\n","      <td>March 13, 2019 at 10:24 am</td>\n","      <td>{'tones': [{'score': 0.69016, 'tone_id': 'joy', 'tone_name': 'Joy'}, {'score': 0.927269, 'tone_id': 'analytical', 'tone_name': 'Analytical'}, {'score': 0.695095, 'tone_id': 'tentative', 'tone_name': 'Tentative'}]}</td>\n","      <td>[[Joy, 69.02%], [Analytical, 92.73%], [Tentative, 69.51%]]</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>mastergousau2</td>\n","      <td>https://www.inspire.com/m/mastergousau2/</td>\n","      <td>**Attached photo(uncircumcised flaccid penis(foreskin stretched out), u've been warned) is strictly only for viewer/reader's educational and/or ease of reference in relation to my question.\\n\\ni'm a 28 years old male.\\n\\nCan someone confirm is this fordyce spot or genital herpes or genital wart ??\\n\\nBACKGROUND FACTS:\\n(1)On 18th June 2019 (Tuesday), i got my STD test result through blood test(IgG/IgM test) and came back positive with HSV-1(oral, but without symptom) with an index value of 35.1. Needless to say, i freaked out(felt sad, angry, depressed, embarrassed, hopeless, in denial, etc etc all at the same time). Clinical doctor then referred me to a STD specialist doctor for treatment.\\n\\n(2) 19th June 2019 (Wednesday), when i went to see the specialist doctor preparing to ask for medication treatment, to my surprise, he immediately and confidently dismissed my previous test result saying that it's false positive after asking whether i have any symptoms for herpes(both oral and genital). I told him i do not but told him to examine my body(waist and above) as i'm not sure the spots on my upper body(waist above) are acne, moles or herpes. The specialist examined my body and confirmed it's not herpes. I have never experienced any cold sores or any itching/pain on my genital areas. He did ask me do i have any lesions on my genitalia area and i verbally described it to him none(do not feel pain, itching or feel any sore) and it doesn't look like those pictures i've googled but did told him i have white spots around my penis shaft n suggested it could be fordyce n he just agreed with me(without examining it though). **NOTE: (1) the white spots around my penis shaft doesnt seem to cause me any pain or any discomfort at all....(2)gotta say though, in my mind i was like \"dafuq?? just like that ?? i really have no herpes despite the report??\" kinda find it hard to believe to my surprise...because just 24 hours ago i was prepared to live a single life for the rest of my life then the next day i'm hearing another news, one heck of a roller coaster of emotion**\\n\\n(3) In summary, he told me:\\n(a) i do not have herpes despite my test result saying i have oral herpes,\\n\\n(b) my previous blood test result is definitely a false positive(yeah, he's so confident to the point he didn't even use words like \"highly unlikely\" or \"unlikely\" n went on to boast his credentials of being a practitioner for STDs for 30 years n being trained by professionals, dealing with over-thinking patients like me, etc etc) because the IgG/IgM test method is obsolete and inaccurate(he went on to give me an example saying that if a weighing scale machine only has 50% chance of being accurate would u still use that weighing scale machine to measure your weight?? kinda make sense to me), and said that the more and most accurate test method is the Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test,\\n\\n(c) despite the obsolete and inaccurate methods of IgG/IgM test, some general practitioners still do such test because of wanting to earn money,\\n\\n(d) people without showing any symptoms of herpes(both oral and genital) despite their positive result conducted through IgG/IgM test are false positive results,\\n\\n(e) that he will only consider conducting a PCR test on me ONLY IF i have any symptoms(lesions, outbreaks,etc) or suspected symptom(then i should only go see him again for a physical examination of the suspected symptom before deciding to conduct a PCR test),\\n\\n(f) not to go mess around by going for another blood test to get confirmation because of reason mentioned in (b) and the fact that this will cause me psychological anxiety/stress due to over-analysing and told me to stop reading stuff on the internet(lol, but im still here posting this :P)\\n\\n(g) even if i really do have oral herpes even after a PRC test, then it's still non-harmful and i can still live a normal life, have a family and kids(then he went on further to explain things like half of world population has HSV-1 and how non-harmful it is, the male sperm doesn't carry the herpes, blablabla i don't know he told me lots of stuff i couldn't remember all of it)\\n**UNRELATED SIDE NOTE: the time i spent talking and consulting with the specialist was around 40minues+, he was actually very down to earth n a chill person**\\n\\nCONCLUSION:\\nso because after consulting my doctor, i realised i should've taken a picture of the white/green spots around my penis shaft to show him so he can have a better view for his confirmation rather through my verbal description. That's why, right now, i'm asking the internet/world for your personal opinion....I'm not sure when exactly i have these white spots though, it's quite possible i may have it like few years back especially when i was like 21(2012), still not sure, just a guess,...bottom line i don't know when i have it.....So what's your opinion on the picture ??\\n\\nThanks in advance for reading and/or replying this post.\\nEdited June 19, 2019 at 1:08 pm</td>\n","      <td>June 19, 2019 at 12:56 pm</td>\n","      <td>{'tones': [{'score': 0.607074, 'tone_id': 'sadness', 'tone_name': 'Sadness'}, {'score': 0.651158, 'tone_id': 'joy', 'tone_name': 'Joy'}, {'score': 0.862401, 'tone_id': 'tentative', 'tone_name': 'Tentative'}, {'score': 0.783643, 'tone_id': 'analytical', 'tone_name': 'Analytical'}]}</td>\n","      <td>[[Sadness, 60.71%], [Joy, 65.12%], [Tentative, 86.24%], [Analytical, 78.36%]]</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>khack2471</td>\n","      <td>https://www.inspire.com/m/khack2471/</td>\n","      <td>Since I have had hpv on numerous of occasions in the past and experienced genital warts and had them removed, will I be contagious for the rest of my life?
